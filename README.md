# Calculator Project for Controls Subteam - Team Steam Robotics (FRC 5119)

## Overview
Welcome to the Controls Subteam Calculator Project! In this assignment, you will work collaboratively to create a basic calculator using Java. The focus is on implementing fundamental arithmetic operations, which will be tested using variables stored in pre-defined inputs. This project emphasizes working with doubles, basic mathematical operations, and correctly printing results to the console.

By completing this project, you will:
- Learn to implement math operations in Java using variables.
- Work with GitHub for version control, emphasizing branching, merging, and collaboration.

## Assignment Structure
The following files are provided to you:

- `Calculator.java` (Unused for this assignment)
- `Addition.java`
- `Subtraction.java`
- `Multiplication.java`
- `Division.java`
- `Exponent.java`

Each file corresponds to a specific arithmetic operation. The inputs are already provided in the form of two variables, `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, so you don't need to worry about setting up input handling. Your task is to apply the appropriate math logic to these variables and print the correct result to the console.

## Objectives
- **Teamwork and Branching:** Work in groups, with each team member responsible for different files. You will use separate branches to implement the logic for the operation in each file, then merge your changes into the main project.
- **Mathematical Operations and Output:** Write the logic for the arithmetic operation assigned to each file using the variables `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`. After performing the operation, you must ensure that the correct result is printed to the console, as this will be tested during manual grading.

## Tasks
For each of the following files, implement the required logic using **double** variables and print the correct result to the console:

1. **Addition.java:** Implement the logic to add `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` and print the result.
2. **Subtraction.java:** Implement the logic to subtract `secondNumber` from `firstNumber` and print the result.
3. **Multiplication.java:** Implement the logic to multiply `firstNumber` by `secondNumber` and print the result.
4. **Division.java:** Implement the logic to divide `firstNumber` by `secondNumber` and print the result.
5. **Exponent.java:** Implement the logic to raise `firstNumber` to the power of `secondNumber` and print the result.

### Boilerplate Overview
Each Java file includes:
- Pre-defined variables `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`, which are already set up for you.
- Your task is to write the appropriate mathematical logic and print the result to the console.

## Guidelines
- **Branching:** Each team member must work on a separate file using their own branch. This ensures that each operation is developed independently.
- **Merging:** Once a member completes their task on their branch, the team should review and merge the changes into the main project to ensure the full functionality of the calculator.
- **Version Control:** You are expected to use GitHub for tracking progress and collaboration. 
  - Make frequent commits, each one clearly reflecting the work done. For example:
    - "Added addition logic to Addition.java"
    - "Implemented exponent operation in Exponent.java"
  - Ensure commit messages are specific and informative, providing a clear history of the work completed.

## Grading Criteria
Your work will be evaluated based on:
- **Correctness of Output:** Each file will be graded based on whether the correct input results in the correct output for the operation.
- **Console Output:** The result must be printed correctly to the console for each operation.
- **Version Control:** Proper use of branches and consistent, clear commits that reflect your progress. Branches must be merged properly without conflicts.

Each file will be graded separately, and points will be awarded based on the correctness of the respective operation.

## Submission and Testing
- **Testing Process:** Tests will be run as needed when your team requests a progress check. Ensure all changes have been merged into the main branch before requesting a test run.
- **Output Requirements:** Make sure the result of your operations is correctly printed to the console. Any incorrect or missing output will result in a reduction in points.
